# check checksum

I needed this same function for two things, so I'm using this to play with 
writing module in es6/es2015.

## install


## test

Runs test and generates code coverage report.
```
npm test
```

## example


```es6
import check_checksum from 'check_checksum';

```


## handy when coding 
```
npm link .
```

I was trying to follow along with the examples here:
